Starting with GitHub


Hi! My name is Marco and i'm from Finland. I Recently started a school of coding, Front-End Development. Before, i've never done any coding but let's see how i get done with this. So far, i find math to be hardest challenge in coding as i'm very bad on it but i won't give up!
